key must be [d:]index:data where
  'd:'     means default (transmit) key
  'index:' is a single digit (0-3)
  'data'   must be 5 or 13 ascii chars
           or 10 or 26 hex digits
for example: d:2:6162636465 is the same as d:2:abcde
or psk:data <AKM Suite> <pairwise CIPHER> <groupwise CIPHER> where
  'data' is the PSK (output of wpa_passphrase and the CIPHER can be CCMP or GCMP
for example: psk:0123456789abcdef PSK CCMP CCMP
The allowed AKM suites are PSK, FT/PSK, PSK/SHA-256
The allowed Cipher suites are TKIP, CCMP, GCMP, GCMP-256, CCMP-256
